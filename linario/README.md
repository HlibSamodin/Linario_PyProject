# Linario

Pure Python linear algebra implementation without external dependencies.

## Overview

Linario is a linear algebra library built entirely in Python to understand matrix and vector operations from first principles. This project focuses on learning Python fundamentals through practical implementation of mathematical concepts.

## Objectives

- Implement linear algebra operations using native Python
- Understand the underlying mechanics of matrix and vector calculations
- Develop programming skills through mathematical problem-solving
- Create a functional library without third-party dependencies

## Planned Features

**Matrix Operations**

- Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
- Transpose and determinant
- Matrix inversion

**Vector Operations**

- Dot and cross products
- Magnitude and normalization

**Advanced Features**

- Linear system solving
- Matrix transformations

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HlibSamodi/Linario_PyProject.git
cd Linario_PyProject
python main.py
```

## Usage

Documentation will be added as features are implemented.

## Status

Currently in early development.
